exploration into exiting a program in AS

fin performs a software interrupr by calling int (short for interrupt) 0x80.
Int 0x80 is a legacy way to invoke a system call.

First, required arguments are passed to the registers.

Then, int 0x80 passes control to the interrupt vector. Program flow is transfered to  the interrupt handler. In linux, the kernel handles 0x80 interrupts. 

Then, the value of RAX (64) or EAX (32) defines the system call. 

A value of 1 is passed for Linux exit().

Removing int 0x80 will cause a seg. fault.
